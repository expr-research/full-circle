Dear <%= @application.user.alt_name  %>

Iâ€™d like to thank you for applying for the <%= @application.cohort.title %> Turing School of Software & Design Diversity Scholarship. I regret to inform you that you were not selected to receive an award.

Turing School received many strong applications this round. We had a very difficult time selecting scholarship recipients for this cohort because of the passion and need of each candidate.

We are looking forward to having you here at Turing next month, and we are excited to be part of this next stage in your journey.

Thank you for sharing your story with us. We look forward to helping you achieve your dreams.
