  Dear <%= @application.user.alt_name  %>
</p>

<p>
  Iâ€™d like to thank you for applying for the <%= @application.cohort.title %> Turing School of Software & Design Diversity Scholarship. I regret to inform you that you were not selected to receive an award.
</p>

<p>
  Turing School received many strong applications this round. We had a very difficult time selecting scholarship recipients for this cohort because of the passion and need of each candidate.
</p>

<p>
  We are looking forward to having you here at Turing next month, and we are excited to be part of this next stage in your journey.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for sharing your story with us. We look forward to helping you achieve your dreams.
